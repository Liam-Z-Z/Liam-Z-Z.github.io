## Abstract
Generative AI systems now produce images, text, audio, and video at scale. While creativity flourishes, provenance and misuse concerns surge in parallel. Watermarking—embedding imperceptible signals into the generated content—has re-emerged as a pragmatic line of defence for ownership attribution, content filtering, and forensic auditing. This short survey outlines core motivations, classifies current watermarking approaches for AIGC, and highlights pressing research challenges.

## 1 Introduction
Large-scale generative models such as diffusion models, autoregressive language models, and generative adversarial networks can synthesize content that rivals or surpasses human work. Verifying authorship and ensuring responsible deployment therefore require technical measures. Digital watermarking, a field dating back to the 1990s, is being retrofitted and reinvented for AIGC. Unlike classic watermarking, AIGC scenarios introduce (i) high-dimensional latent spaces, (ii) probabilistic generation, and (iii) cross-modal outputs, all of which reshape design constraints.

## 2 Why Watermark AIGC?

| Goal | Typical Use Cases | Design Priorities |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Ownership Attribution** | Creator claims for digital art, paid datasets | Low perceptual impact, public verifiability |
| **Provenance Tracking** | Platform-level “AI-tag” disclosure | Robustness to common post-processing |
| **Content Filtering** | Prevent model outputs from bypassing safety filters | Fast detection, real-time inference |
| **Tamper Evidence** | Detect adversarial editing or deepfake manipulations | Fragile or semi-fragile signatures |

## 3 Taxonomy of AIGC Watermarking

### 3.1 Visibility
* **Visible**: Easily perceived logos or text; minimal decoding effort but low aesthetic tolerance.  
* **Invisible**: Imperceptible perturbations; require detectors or keys for extraction.

### 3.2 Embedding Stage
* **During Generation**: Modify sampling trajectory (e.g., token logits, diffusion noise) to encode bits.  
* **Post-Generation**: Additive or transformation-based embedding after the final output.

### 3.3 Decoding Paradigm
* **Blind**: Decoder needs no original.  
* **Non-Blind**: Original or model access improves signal recovery.

## 4 Technique Landscape by Modality

### 4.1 Images
* **Latent Perturbation**: Flip sign of selected diffusion noise vectors to encode multi-bit payloads.  
* **Frequency-Domain⁠**: Embed watermarks in DCT or wavelet coefficients; resilient to mild compression.  
* **Neural Steganography**: Train a small encoder–decoder pair jointly with the generator for end-to-end optimization.

### 4.2 Text
* **Vocabulary Partitioning**: Split tokens into “0” and “1” sets; sample conditionally to form bit streams.  
* **Gradient Biasing**: Add pseudo-random bias to logits at each step; detector uses the same seed to verify.  
* **Syntactic Templates**: Constrain output grammar so that parse trees reveal embedded patterns.

### 4.3 Audio & Speech
* **Phase Coding**: Alter short-time Fourier transform phases within psychoacoustic thresholds.  
* **Neural Codec Tuning**: Fine-tune generative codecs to place signature bits in redundant latent channels.

### 4.4 Video
* Combine image-level marks with temporal redundancy checks. Inter-frame coherence boosts robustness against resampling and re-encoding.

## 5 Challenges & Open Questions
1. **Robustness vs. Fidelity** Higher payloads and stronger resilience often degrade quality—finding optimal trade-offs remains non-trivial.  
2. **Model Leakage** Embedding during generation may leak private keys if adversaries access gradients or logits.  
3. **Cross-Model Transfer** Generated content can be re-used by other models; how to maintain provenance across modalities?  
4. **Evaluation Benchmarks** Lack of standardized datasets and adversarial threat models hampers fair comparison.  
5. **Regulatory Alignment** Technical watermarking must integrate with evolving legal frameworks on AI transparency.

## 6 Future Directions
* **Layer-wise Regularization** for minimal perceptibility loss in diffusion models.  
* **Self-Verifying Payloads** using error-correcting codes and cryptographic commitments.  
* **Adaptive Detectors** powered by contrastive learning to recognize watermarks under unseen distortions.  
* **Cross-Modal Signatures** embedding identical IDs consistently across image, text, and audio outputs of the same prompt.  
* **Open-Source Evaluation Suites** fostering reproducible research and industry adoption.

## 7 Conclusion
Watermarking stands out as a lightweight yet impactful safeguard amid the rapid expansion of generative AI. While classic principles inform its design, AIGC-specific constraints introduce fresh challenges, from probabilistic decoding to multi-modal resilience. Continued interdisciplinary work—blending signal processing, cryptography, and deep learning—is essential for trustworthy and transparent generative ecosystems.
